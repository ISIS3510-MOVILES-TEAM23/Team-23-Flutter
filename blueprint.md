### Iteration 1: E-commerce App Foundation

The initial version of the app will focus on setting up the basic structure and navigation.

**Steps:**

1.  **Set up the project:** Add `go_router`, `google_fonts`, and `provider` dependencies.
2.  **Create data models:** Define `Product` and `Category` classes.
3.  **Create placeholder data:** Create sample data for products and categories.
4.  **Set up routing:** Use `go_router` to manage navigation between screens, including a bottom navigation bar.
5.  **Create screens:** Implement the Home, Categories, Category List, Product Detail, and Profile screens.
6.  **Implement the theme:** Create a custom theme in `lib/main.dart`.
7.  **Update main.dart:** Integrate the router and theme.
